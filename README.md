**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**

The cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are a form of digital currency designed to work outside of the traditional banking ecosystem. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized 
currencies that use blockchain technology to record transactions. Cryptocurrency transactions, aka the buying and selling of digital currency, are typically handled using a crypto-exchange platform. These transactions often involve large sums of cryptocurrency, typically anonymized utilizing the blockchain, hence attracting cybercriminals. Like any system, cryptocurrency platforms and exchange mechanisms are vulnerable to cyberattacks. Proliferation of cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin) that allow pseudo-anonymous transactions, has made it easier for ransomware developers to demand ransom by encrypting sensitive user data. The recently revealed strikes of 
ransomware attacks have already resulted in significant economic losses and societal harm across different sectors, ranging from local governments to health care. Most 
modern ransomware use Bitcoin for payments. However, although Bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded and publicly available, current approaches for detecting 
ransomware depend only on a couple of heuristics and/or tedious information gathering steps (e.g., running ransomware to collect ransomware related Bitcoin addresses).
